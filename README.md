# Bikeshare Project

This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major US cities:
- Chicago

- The most frequent times of travel  
- The most popular stations and trips  
- Trip duration statistics  
- User statistics (types, gender, and birth year)

## Files Included
- **bikeshare.py** – main Python script for interactive data exploration  
- **refactor_notes.txt** – summary of the code improvements made  
- **README.md** – project description and overview  
- **.gitignore** – excludes data files (`*.csv`) from version control  

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Run the program using the command:  
3. When prompted, enter one of the following cities:
